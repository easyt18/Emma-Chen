My name is Yuetong Chen, an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen. I am a member of the Multimodal Research Group, led by [Butian Xiong](https://saliteta.github.io/) and guided by Professor [ZhenLi](https://mypage.cuhk.edu.cn/academics/lizhen/). Our research primarily revolves around 3D representations. I am deeply fascinated by the intricacies of 3D representations and am eager to delve deeper into this field to expand my knowledge further.
